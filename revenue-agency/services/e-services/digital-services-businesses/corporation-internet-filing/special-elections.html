<div class="alert alert-info">
    <p>To avoid processing delays, please use the most recent versions of the forms.</p>
    <p>The following new prescribed form has been developed for subsection 184(3) elections:&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Form <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2184.html">T2184</a></li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>Use this page to find the filing options and instructions for special elections and returns.</p>
<p>Special elections are filed by taxpayers to qualify for certain tax provisions. In most cases, these provisions are used to eliminate or defer the tax consequences of specific transactions.</p>
<p>Special elections are filed voluntarily by the taxpayer. In contrast, filing a special return is mandatory. The taxpayer must file it with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) by the due date indicated on the form.</p>
<p>The CRA uses the information from these forms to administer the Income Tax Act and Income Tax Regulations.</p>
